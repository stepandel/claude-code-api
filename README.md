# Cantelop Claude Code API

A **Cantelop SDK application** with an Edge API and a native Session behaviour. Uses `@cantelop/sdk@0.10.0`: Cantelop allocates Sandboxes, mounts durable per-user Workspaces, serializes actor messages, supervises activities, and transports output through SSE/WebSockets. Claude Code runs as Anthropic's unmodified native executable inside the Sandbox.

SDK reference: [upstream documentation](https://github.com/stepandel/cantelop-sdk/tree/sdk-v0.10.0). Version 0.10.0 was verified against GitHub and npm on September 21, 2026. Builds require a Cantelop CLI compatible with SDK build protocol 5 (verified with CLI 0.9.2). The API artifact publishes all 11 application routes for the Cantelop console.

## Architecture

- `src/api.ts`: `defineApi`, JWT verification, `app.workspaces.open`, `app.sessions.open`, dispatch, and authenticated event streaming. No local server or Docker daemon management.
- `src/session.ts`: `defineSessionBehaviour`, managed activities for long-running turns, queue/steer/cancel handling, and recovery.
- `src/login.ts`, `src/login-process.ts`, and `runtime/login-pty.py`: native login lifecycle and PTY relay.
- `src/login-page.ts` and `src/terminal-crypto.ts`: login screen and encrypted terminal transport.
- `src/claude.ts`: native CLI subprocess, process-group cancellation, stream parsing, explicit tool/MCP settings, and native authentication status.
- `src/state.ts`: atomic snapshots of configuration, queue, message status, and Claude conversation identity under `/workspace/.cantelop`.
- `cantelop.json` and `docker/Dockerfile`: Edge/Session entrypoints and system dependencies. Cantelop supplies the runtime user, startup command, and `/workspace` mount.

Each application identity maps to a server-derived Workspace slug. Separate sessions for that user mount the same Workspace. Claude's own authentication state lives in `/workspace/.claude` via `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`; the application never reads or exports those credentials. Each logical Session stores a distinct Claude conversation ID and configuration.

## Authentication boundary

Open **`/login`** on your App's origin. Enter an application access token from your identity system and select **Connect Claude**. The page opens the native Claude Code login in the user's auth Sandbox. Open the displayed Anthropic link, sign in with your subscription, and enter any completion code only when the native terminal asks for it. The page confirms success after checking `claude auth status`.

Application identity and Claude identity remain separate. Your backend issues an ES256 JWT with `sub`, `iss`, `aud`, and `exp` (optional `nbf`); Cantelop receives only its public verification key. The terminal runs the unmodified `claude auth login` command with `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=/workspace/.claude`. Claude handles the OAuth exchange and persists its own credentials. The application does not implement an OAuth callback or extract Claude's tokens.

The page is a small line-oriented login console, not a general shell. It uses a Python standard-library PTY helper installed in the runtime image. Input echo is disabled; sending an empty response presses Enter. Native terminal output is rendered as inert text, and only Anthropic-domain HTTPS links are made clickable. No external frontend assets or build step are required.

Each login attempt has a ten-minute lifetime and a unique ID. Only one attempt can run in the user's deterministic auth Session. Cancellation terminates and reaps the native process group. Network reconnection uses Cantelop event replay while the page remains open. Closing or refreshing the page discards its temporary keys; cancel the old attempt or wait for expiry before starting another. Sandbox recovery emits `auth.reset`; unfinished login attempts are not resumed.

### Terminal transport

The SDK sends dispatch payloads through the platform and supports bounded event replay; it does not promise zero retention of platform payloads. Accordingly, the browser and auth Session negotiate a temporary P-256 ECDH key and use AES-256-GCM for **both input and output**. Cantelop dispatch and replay receive ciphertext. Private transport keys live only in browser/Session memory and are never saved in the Workspace. This protects stored transport payloads, not a compromised browser, runtime, or application server.

Application code never logs terminal input/output or persists a terminal transcript. The helper discards stderr diagnostics. Claude itself owns its native configuration and any native diagnostic files. Authentication status and attempt metadata remain visible to the platform. Keep TLS enabled and apply your deployment's access/logging policies.

Anthropic's [hosting conditions](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/legal-and-compliance#can-customers-offer-claude-code-in-their-products) describe hosting the unmodified binary under Commercial Terms with end-user authentication and billing. Its [credential conditions](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/legal-and-compliance#authentication-and-credential-use) distinguish native sign-in from a third-party Claude login or credential intermediary. This scaffold is designed around that distinction; it is not legal approval. Review the full terms for your deployment. Checked September 18, 2026.

## Local setup

Requires Node.js 22+, the Cantelop CLI, Bun, and Docker with `linux/amd64` support.

```sh
npm ci
cp .env.example .env
# Set AUTH_PUBLIC_JWK, AUTH_ISSUER, and AUTH_AUDIENCE for your identity provider.
npm run check
npm test
npm run build
npm run dev
```

Use an ES256 JWT issued by your application authentication system as `USER_TOKEN`, matching the public key, issuer, and audience configured in `.env`. Use the API base URL printed by `cantelop dev` as `BASE_URL`. The project does not issue application tokens.

`npm run build` runs `cantelop build`, which reads `cantelop.json` and builds both the Edge API and native Session image. For a reproducible production image, pin the Dockerfile's `CLAUDE_VERSION` to an audited version; the scaffold defaults to Anthropic's stable channel.

## API usage

For interactive subscription login, use `/login`. Programmatic clients can implement the same terminal protocol:

1. `POST /v1/auth` with `{}` allocates the user's Workspace and returns HTTP 200 with the auth `sessionId`, Workspace identifiers, `/login` URL, `type: "auth.status"`, and `authenticated: boolean` from the native authentication check. No event subscription is needed for this check.
2. Subscribe to `/v1/events?sessionId=...` **before** starting the terminal.
3. Generate a temporary ECDH P-256 key pair. `POST /v1/auth` with `{ "attemptId": "<UUID>", "publicKey": <public JWK> }` starts login. Private JWK fields are rejected.
4. `auth.started` returns the Session's public JWK and `expiresAt`. Derive the AES-GCM key using `src/terminal-crypto.ts`. Encrypted `auth.output` events carry `terminalSequence`, `iv`, and `data`. Decrypt with additional authenticated data `<attemptId>:output:<terminalSequence>`.
5. Send encrypted terminal bytes to `POST /v1/auth/input` as `{attemptId, sequence, iv, data}`. Input sequence starts at 1; AAD is `<attemptId>:input:<sequence>`. IV is 12 random bytes; IV and ciphertext use standard base64. Input is limited to 4 KiB per frame and 32 KiB per attempt. Duplicate accepted sequences are ignored; gaps are rejected. No plaintext code field is accepted.
6. `POST /v1/auth/cancel` with `{attemptId}` stops an attempt. `auth.finished` reports the outcome and native authentication status. `POST /v1/auth/complete` with `{}` returns HTTP 200 with `{sessionId, type: "auth.status", authenticated}` directly.

The server derives the auth Session from the caller's JWT; clients cannot select a different user's terminal. The browser implementation in `src/login-page.ts` demonstrates the complete flow, including subscribing before dispatch and handling encrypted event replay.

Create a configured agent Session:

```sh
curl "$BASE_URL/v1/sessions" -H "Authorization: Bearer $USER_TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"tools":["Read","Glob","Grep"],"allowedTools":["Read","Glob","Grep"],"mcps":{}}'
```

Optional session execution settings can be supplied alongside MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "model": "sonnet",
  "systemPrompt": "You operate this canvas using only the supplied Doop tools.",
  "maxTurns": 24,
  "tools": [],
  "allowedTools": ["mcp__doop__*"],
  "mcps": {
    "doop": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://your-doop.example/local-agent/mcp/RUN_ID",
      "headers": {"Authorization": "Bearer RUN_SCOPED_TOKEN"}
    }
  }
}
```

- `model`: optional native model alias or ID, 1–128 ASCII letters, digits, dots, underscores or hyphens, starting with a letter or digit. Omit it or use `default` for Claude's native default. Availability is determined by the user's account and installed Claude version.
- `systemPrompt`: optional nonblank replacement for Claude's default system prompt, at most 32 KiB in UTF-8. Passed using a private temporary file, removed after the turn, and persisted as part of the Session configuration. It is not appended to the user's message.
- `maxTurns`: optional integer from 1 to 100, applied to each message, including resumed turns. Omission retains Claude's native default. A turn-limit failure is reported as a failed message, not successful completion.

All configuration is immutable and survives reactivation. Create a fresh Session when changing models, prompts, or run-scoped MCP tokens. Model usage still requires the user's native Claude authentication; these fields do not accept provider credentials.

Message `text` accepts up to 32 KiB of UTF-8. Every POST body remains limited to 48 KiB of encoded JSON, including configuration, MCP headers, and JSON escaping. Larger context must be fetched through MCP or split into separate tasks.

Session creation is asynchronous: observe `session.ready` and `auth.status`. A Session can be configured before native sign-in; each turn rechecks authentication and fails without starting a model call if unauthenticated. Store the returned `sessionId` as `SESSION_ID`.

`tools` selects available built-in tools; it defaults to none. `allowedTools` grants unattended execution for the listed tool names or native rules. Other permissions are denied (`dontAsk`); there is no blanket permission bypass. Custom tools are MCP tools, not JSON function declarations.

`mcps` is a name-to-server map. For example:

```json
{
  "docs": {"type":"http","url":"https://your-mcp.example/mcp"},
  "local": {"type":"stdio","command":"node","args":["/workspace/tools/server.js"]}
}
```

HTTP/SSE servers may include `headers`; stdio servers may include `env`. Tool code and dependencies must exist in the Sandbox. MCP settings may contain secrets and are persisted within the user's Workspace. Grant matching permissions explicitly, such as `mcp__docs__search`. Session configuration is immutable; create a new Session to change it.

Send queued or steering messages:

```sh
curl "$BASE_URL/v1/messages" -H "Authorization: Bearer $USER_TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"sessionId\":\"$SESSION_ID\",\"text\":\"Inspect this project\",\"mode\":\"queue\"}"

curl "$BASE_URL/v1/messages" -H "Authorization: Bearer $USER_TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"sessionId\":\"$SESSION_ID\",\"text\":\"Focus on authentication\",\"mode\":\"steer\"}"
```

Each response has a platform `receiptId` and an application `messageId`. Supply an optional UUID `messageId` to retry a message idempotently; reusing it with different text emits `message_id_conflict`.

Cancel an active or queued application message:

```sh
curl "$BASE_URL/v1/cancel" -H "Authorization: Bearer $USER_TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"sessionId\":\"$SESSION_ID\",\"messageId\":\"$MESSAGE_ID\"}"
```

Watch output:

```sh
curl -N "$BASE_URL/v1/events?sessionId=$SESSION_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $USER_TOKEN"
```

This returns SDK-native SSE. WebSocket clients use the `cantelop.events.v1` subprotocol and must supply the bearer header through a compatible client. Browser `EventSource` and browser WebSocket constructors cannot set arbitrary Authorization headers; a browser integration needs a same-origin backend/cookie adapter. Tokens are deliberately not accepted in query strings.

The SDK handles bounded replay using `Last-Event-ID` or `stream_id`/`after` query parameters. Large Claude frames are emitted as `claude.fragment`: concatenate `json` by `eventId` and `index`, then parse when `total` fragments arrive. Other frames use `claude`. Events are private model output and may contain user data.

Request a durable state snapshot after a stream reset:

```sh
curl "$BASE_URL/v1/snapshot" -H "Authorization: Bearer $USER_TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d "{\"sessionId\":\"$SESSION_ID\"}"
```

The HTTP 200 response contains `{sessionId, type: "session.state", configured, messages, truncated}` directly, with the latest 50 messages and prompt previews capped at 256 characters. It is a summary, not a full transcript API. Sandbox recovery still emits a `session.state` event.

| Method | Route | Behaviour |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/health` | Public liveness |
| GET | `/login` | Native login page (API actions require a bearer token) |
| POST | `/v1/auth` | Allocate Workspace, check auth, or start encrypted native login |
| POST | `/v1/auth/input` | Send encrypted input to the caller’s login terminal |
| POST | `/v1/auth/cancel` | Cancel the caller’s active login attempt |
| POST | `/v1/auth/complete` | Return native authentication status directly |
| POST | `/v1/sessions` | Create and configure a Session |
| POST | `/v1/messages` | Queue or steer a message |
| POST | `/v1/cancel` | Cancel a queued or active message |
| POST | `/v1/snapshot` | Return persisted Session summary directly |
| GET | `/v1/events?sessionId=...` | SDK SSE/WebSocket stream |

All API routes except health require an application JWT; the static login page is public. Workspace selection is derived from verified identity; clients cannot select another user's Workspace. Session ownership is checked before dispatch, requests, and event subscription.

With SDK 0.11.0, auth checks and snapshots use `session.request()` and return HTTP 200 with the result instead of a 202 receipt. Clients must read these response bodies instead of waiting for status/snapshot events. Requests wait up to 30 seconds; timeout returns HTTP 504 with `code: "request_wait_timeout"`. A timeout or disconnect stops waiting, not execution; these read-only checks can be repeated. Interactive login start/input/cancel, Session configuration, and model queue/steer/cancel remain asynchronous (202), with outcomes delivered as events. Use a deployed platform for request/reply verification; CLI 0.10.0's local development bridge does not support the request endpoint.

## Queue, cancellation, and durability

Cantelop serializes command handlers in the Session mailbox. A managed activity runs a turn while the mailbox stays responsive. The application persists its pending prompt queue separately from the platform mailbox. Only one turn runs per Session.

- `queue`: FIFO after pending work.
- `steer`: interrupt the active native process group, wait for termination, then run the steering prompt before pending work. Repeated steering is newest-first. This is interrupt-and-resume, not mid-generation injection.
- `cancel`: remove a queued message or terminate the active turn. Finished messages are unchanged. Completed tool effects cannot be undone.

The runner uses SIGTERM, then SIGKILL for stubborn process groups, and waits before starting the next turn. Tools that deliberately detach into their own process group may outlive a turn; Sandbox termination is the broader cleanup boundary.

Configuration, message IDs/statuses, pending queue, and conversation identity survive Sandbox loss. On reactivation, previously running work becomes `interrupted` and is **not replayed** because tools may already have produced effects. The recovery hook resumes only queued work. Output events use Cantelop's bounded in-memory stream; full event history is not durable. Claude manages its own native transcript. An interruption before the transcript is written can make a later resume fail and may require a new Session.

Sessions share files within the same user's Workspace; concurrent sessions can edit the same files. Data persists when Cantelop releases a Sandbox. A Session retains at most 1,000 application messages; create a new Session after that. Queue snapshots are atomically replaced; this is not a general transactional database or an exactly-once tool-execution guarantee.

## Deployment and remaining work

Configure the public identity settings in `cantelop.json` through Cantelop App configuration, then use the standard `cantelop doctor` / `cantelop deploy --dry-run` / `cantelop deploy` workflow. A dry run builds without publishing.

The deployment target created on September 19, 2026 is `cantelop-claude-api` (`app_ec792797727123ecb98676c7e98e7e73`). Check activation with `npx cantelop releases`; submitting a deployment does not by itself mean it is live.

For deployment diagnostics, use `cantelop releases --json` to inspect each component's status, attempts, and error code. Release v1's API succeeded, but its Session runtime failed with `provider_materialization_timeout` after 100 attempts. CLI 0.8.3 adds `cantelop deploy restart --release RELEASE_ID`, which reuses uploaded artifacts after provider cancellation completes and automatically creates a replacement release. Wait for that replacement to become active before checking the live endpoints; a `cancelling` response only acknowledges the restart request.

Initial owner access uses a dedicated ES256 signing key, issuer `cantelop-claude-api-owner`, and audience `cantelop-claude-api`. Only the public verification settings are configured in Cantelop. On the machine that created this deployment, `.cantelop/deployment-auth/signing-key.pem` holds the private key and `.cantelop/deployment-auth/owner-token.txt` holds the initial bearer token (expires September 20, 2026 at 20:09:59 UTC). These files have owner-only permissions and are excluded from Git and Docker builds. Paste the token into `/login` once the release is active. The token authenticates the local owner identity; Claude subscription authentication still uses the native login flow. This initial access setup is not a multi-user identity provider. Keep the key secure and issue a fresh token or configure your identity provider when the initial token expires.

Before production: integrate your identity issuer and key rotation/revocation strategy, add user quotas and admission/rate limits, and define Workspace retention/backup/deletion policies. Review network access for your MCP services under Cantelop's sandbox policy. Do not place shared provider credentials or application signing keys in App environment variables visible to native Sessions.

## Verification

Tests exercise actual SDK route definitions, JWT/tenant checks, Workspace/Session dispatch, managed activity queue/steer/cancel behaviour, durable reactivation, output fragmentation, and native subprocess parsing/cancellation using a fake Claude executable. They do not call a model or use subscription credentials. The login tests use a fake interactive Claude executable, verify PTY input/cancellation, and execute the compiled browser page against the real API handlers with simulated native login. A real subscription authorization and model turn require the user’s own account; automated tests do not sign in as the user.

### Re-authentication

The native CLI owns credential refresh in the durable workspace. Terminal native
`authentication_failed` errors and an explicit signed-out status emit
`auth.required` with the affected message ID. Status command failures are not
classified as sign-out. A successful CLI turn after an internal auth retry does
not emit `auth.required`; billing, rate-limit, and network failures retain normal
failure handling.

Clients should pause new work for the affected user and offer native sign-in.
Pass `force: true` with the public-key handshake to `POST /v1/auth` to open a new
login even when stale saved credentials still report signed in. Verify the
matching `auth.finished` event reports `authenticated: true` and
`outcome: succeeded` before clearing the pause. Interrupted work must not be
replayed automatically because earlier tool actions may already have completed.
